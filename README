Simple wrapper for MP3Trigger serial communication from Arduino.
Also allows you to loop tracks

You need to place MP3Trigger in the right place on your machine
for Arduino libraries. On a Mac, that means MP3Trigger.h and
MP3Trigger.cpp are inside:
~/Documents/Arduino/libraries/MP3Trigger

Basic usage will look like the following:



#include <MP3Trigger.h>
MP3Trigger trigger;
void setup()
{
  //start serial communication with the trigger (over Serial)
  trigger.setup();
  //start looping TRACK001.MP3
  trigger.setLooping(true,1);
}

void loop()
{
  //necessary to receive signals from trigger
  trigger.update();
}

This and other examples for using SoftwareSerial and Quiet Mode is included in
examples.
